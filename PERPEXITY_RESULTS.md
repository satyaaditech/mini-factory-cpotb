What is the current market size of Indonesia's herbal medicine (jamu) industry in 2024-2025? Please provide:

- Total market value in USD and IDR
- Annual growth rate (CAGR)
- Market share breakdown (traditional jamu vs modern herbal supplements)
- Number of UMKM/SMEs in herbal industry
- Official sources from BPS, Ministry of Industry, or industry associations

```

Indonesia’s herbal medicine/jamu market in 2024–2025 is sizable but fragmented in the statistics; the most concrete, recent figure for the broader “herbal medicine” market (including jamu and modern herbal products) is about USD 13.7 billion in 2024 with roughly 7% annual growth, while official Indonesian sources give only partial numbers (domestic jamu sales and projections) rather than one unified market size.[^1_1][^1_2][^1_3][^1_4][^1_5][^1_6]

## 1. Market size (2024–2025)

- A dedicated industry study puts the **Indonesia herbal medicine market** (traditional jamu drinks, herbal supplements, herbal teas, herbal OTC products, etc.) at **USD 13.732 billion in 2024**, with a projection to USD 25.459 billion in 2033.[^1_2][^1_3][^1_6]
- Using a rough exchange rate assumption **IDR 16,000 per USD** (you should swap to your current exact rate), that 2024 value is approximately **IDR 219.7 trillion** (13.732 × 16 ≈ 219.7).[^1_3][^1_6][^1_2]
- BPOM and related jamu campaigns mention **domestic jamu and herbal sales potential** of around **IDR 20 trillion currently**, with **projection about IDR 23 trillion by 2025**, which is a narrower “jamu + herbal products” slice than the full herbal medicine market studies above.[^1_4][^1_5]

So for your deck/research, a realistic framing is:  
- “Indonesia herbal medicine market (including jamu, herbal supplements, teas, etc.) ≈ **USD 13.7B / ±IDR 220T in 2024**.”[^1_6][^1_2][^1_3]
- “Official Indonesian narratives for jamu + herbal products talk about **~IDR 20T–23T domestic sales around 2023–2025**.”[^1_5][^1_4]

## 2. Growth rate (CAGR)

- The same Custom Market Insights research gives a **CAGR of 7.1% for 2024–2033** for the Indonesia herbal medicine market.[^1_2][^1_3][^1_6]
- Government/bureau figures (BPS, Kemenperin, BPOM) do not publish a single official “CAGR jamu” number; instead, they report sectoral growth under broader categories such as “obat tradisional” or “obat bahan alam” inside manufacturing and health-related statistics.[^1_7][^1_8]

You can reasonably quote:  
- “Herbal medicine (incl. jamu) CAGR ≈ **7.1% per year (2024–2033)** from a specialized industry study; official stats only track components, not this combined CAGR.”[^1_3][^1_6][^1_7][^1_2]

## 3. Traditional jamu vs modern herbal supplements

There is no single official BPS/Kemenperin percentage split specifically “traditional jamu vs modern herbal supplements”; available data comes from industry and survey-based analyses and tends to group product types differently.[^1_9][^1_6]

What the data supports qualitatively:  
- The **“herbal medicine market”** in these studies explicitly includes **traditional jamu tonics and drinks, herbal supplements, herbal teas, cosmetics, and OTC herbal medicines.**[^1_6]
- Industry and brokerage reports (e.g., on Sido Muncul) show very strong sales in **packaged jamu and herbal OTC products**, indicating that **modern, packaged herbal supplements and RTD products dominate value**, while **traditional jamu gendong and small-scale jamu outlets are under‑represented in formal value statistics.**[^1_1][^1_9]

Because there is no robust, citable numeric split from official BPS/Kemenperin/BPOM, any exact “x% traditional vs y% modern” figure would be an estimate, not an official statistic.  

If you need a working assumption for internal modeling, you could:  
- Treat **formal/packaged herbal products (modern supplements, OTC herbal) as the majority of the recorded IDR 20T–23T**,  
- Treat **informal traditional jamu sales as material but largely off-book**, and explicitly label that assumption as “author’s estimate based on industry structure,” not an official figure.[^1_4][^1_5][^1_9][^1_1]

## 4. Number of UMKM/SMEs in herbal/jamu

Official stats count enterprises by legal category, not by the everyday word “jamu,” so you have to piece together indications:  

- BPOM’s jamu week note mentions **“>1,000 jamu entrepreneurs nationally”** and **“>150,000 formal workers”**, explicitly stating that informal workers are not yet fully recorded.[^1_4]
- BPOM’s UMKM program text refers to many **UMKM obat tradisional** but does not give a precise national UMKM count; it focuses on support programs rather than a number.[^1_5]
- Kemenperin’s statements on **industri obat bahan alam** say there are multiple categories of companies: **UMOT (Usaha Mikro Obat Tradisional), UKOT (Usaha Kecil Obat Tradisional), IEBA (Industri Ekstrak Bahan Alam), and IOT (Industri Obat Tradisional)**, with around **19,000 jamu products**, **99 standardized herbal medicines (OHT)**, and **33 fitofarmaka** on the market, but again, not a clear “N UMKM” figure.[^1_10][^1_11]

Key takeaway for your slide:  
- “Official communications talk about **>1,000 jamu entrepreneurs** and **150K+ formal workers**, with a structured ecosystem of **UMOT, UKOT, IEBA, and IOT** under Kemenperin and BPOM; however, **no single official national UMKM count exclusively for jamu** is published.”[^1_11][^1_10][^1_5][^1_4]

## 5. Relevant official and semi‑official sources

You asked specifically for BPS, Ministry of Industry, or industry associations. Below are the most directly relevant:  

- **BPOM / Jamu Digital portal** (Pekan Jamu 2024; jamu as national priority industry; domestic and export sales potential ~IDR 20T currently, ~IDR 23T by 2025; >1,000 jamu entrepreneurs; 150,000+ formal workers).[^1_4]
- **BPOM UMKM obat tradisional program** (statement that jamu and herbal sales in Indonesia are expected to reach IDR 23T by 2025, and focus on UMKM development).[^1_5]
- **Kemenperin statements on industri obat bahan alam** (classification of UMOT, UKOT, IOT, IEBA; number of jamu, OHT, and fitofarmaka products).[^1_10][^1_11]
- **BPS**:  
  - Biofarmaka production tables (showing production volume of medicinal plants, useful for upstream supply analysis, not directly jamu sales value).[^1_7]
  - Export statistics for “tanaman obat, aromatik, dan rempah-rempah” which relate to herbal inputs for jamu and herbal products.[^1_12]

For **market-size and CAGR numbers**, you will need to rely on:  
- **Custom Market Insights – Indonesia Herbal Medicine Market 2024–2033** for the USD 13.732B and 7.1% CAGR figures.[^1_2][^1_3][^1_6]
- Local commentary that cites this and similar market-research sources when quoting the same numbers in Indonesian business press and blogs.[^1_1]

## 6. Slide‑ready table (rounded, with caveats)

You said you like data in tables, so here is a compact one you can paste into a deck; just keep the “Source type” column to remind yourself which are official vs market research.

| Item | 2024–2025 value (rounded) | Notes | Source type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Indonesia herbal medicine market size (incl. jamu, herbal supplements, teas, OTC herbal) | ≈ **USD 13.7B** (≈ IDR 220T using 16,000/USD) in 2024 | Industry study; includes traditional and modern herbal products | [^1_2][^1_3][^1_6] |
| Projected herbal medicine market 2033 | ≈ USD 25.5B | Projection with 7.1% CAGR 2024–2033 | [^1_2][^1_3][^1_6] |
| Domestic jamu + herbal sales potential (Indonesia) | ≈ IDR 20T now, projected ≈ IDR 23T in 2025 | BPOM/Badan POM jamu campaigns; narrower than full herbal medicine category | [^1_4][^1_5] |
| CAGR (herbal medicine, 2024–2033) | ≈ 7.1% per year | From Custom Market Insights research | [^1_2][^1_3][^1_6] |
| Number of jamu entrepreneurs | >1,000 | Formal entrepreneurs; informal not fully counted | [^1_4] |
| Number of formal workers in jamu | >150,000 | BPOM estimate; excludes informal | [^1_4] |
| Product counts in industri obat bahan alam | 19,000 jamu products, 99 OHT, 33 fitofarmaka | Kemenperin/industry communication | [^1_10][^1_11] |

If you tell me whether this is for an investor deck, policy brief, or YouTube script, I can help you rephrase these into 1–2 “story” slides with explicit caveats (e.g., “no single official BPS jamu market size; using best-available industry study plus BPOM projections”).

# What are the latest statistics on herbal medicine consumption in Indonesia for 2024-2025? Include:
- Percentage of population using traditional herbal medicine
- Most popular herbal product categories
- Consumer spending on herbal products
- Growth trends and projections through 2030
- Cite official government or industry reports

Indonesia remains a heavy user of traditional herbal medicine; around 6 of 10 Indonesians report consuming jamu or other herbal remedies, and growth in herbal spending is projected to continue through 2030, driven by cultural habits and the broader supplements boom.[^2_1][^2_2][^2_3][^2_4]

## Population using herbal medicine

- The Ministry of Health’s Riset Tumbuhan Obat dan Jamu (Ristoja) surveys, summarized by GP Jamu, state that **about 59.6% of Indonesians consume jamu**, roughly “6 out of 10 people.”[^2_2]
- Riskesdas 2018 data, cited in multiple academic papers, similarly report **59.12% of Indonesians still consume jamu**, with **95.6% of them acknowledging health benefits**, confirming that jamu remains a mainstream practice.[^2_1]
- A 2024 pharmacy‑based study notes that **about 24.4% of respondents use traditional health services or medicines** at a given time, showing substantial ongoing use alongside modern care.[^2_5][^2_6]

You can safely describe 2024–2025 usage as “around 60% of the population has used or still uses jamu/herbal remedies.”[^2_2][^2_1]

## Popular herbal product categories

Evidence from surveys plus market and industry reports points to these leading categories:  

- **Traditional jamu drinks and tonics**: Turmeric‑based (kunyit asam), ginger/jahe, temulawak, beras kencur, and other herbal tonics for stamina, digestion, and women’s health remain widely used.[^2_7][^2_2]
- **Herbal/Traditional OTC products**: Ready‑to‑drink jamu sachets and syrups (e.g., Tolak Angin), jamu capsules and powders, widely sold in pharmacies and warung; leading brands are reported producing hundreds of millions of sachets per month.[^2_8][^2_7]
- **Standardized herbal medicines and phytopharmaca**: A 2024 practice survey among pharmacy customers finds jamu products representing **62% of traditional medicines used**, standardized herbal medicines 35%, and phytopharmaca 3%, illustrating dominance of jamu‑type products within traditional categories.[^2_6][^2_5]
- **Supplements and functional liquids**: Grand View Research notes that **botanical liquid dietary supplements** dominate Indonesia’s liquid supplements segment (31.2% revenue share in 2024), driven by jamu‑style immunity and digestion drinks.[^2_7]

## Consumer spending on herbal products

There is no single government table “household spending on herbal medicine 2024–2025,” but several official and industry figures frame the order of magnitude:  

- BPOM and related jamu campaigns reference **national jamu and herbal sales potential of about IDR 20 trillion currently, projected around IDR 23 trillion by 2025**, as part of the “obat bahan alam” and jamu industry narrative.[^2_9][^2_10]
- An industrial overview citing Custom Market Insights puts the **Indonesia herbal medicine market** (jamu, herbal supplements, teas, OTC herbal products, etc.) at **USD 13.732 billion in 2024**, implying very significant consumer and institutional spending.[^2_8]
- Euromonitor’s “Herbal/Traditional Products in Indonesia” report (paid) tracks **retail sales 2020–2024 with forecasts to 2029**, noting that retail value sales of herbal/traditional products are rising in current terms as consumers lean into natural remedies.[^2_3]

For communication, you can say that **consumer spending on herbal/traditional products is in the tens of trillions of rupiah annually, with broader herbal medicine value exceeding USD 10 billion when including supplements and OTC herbal medicines.**[^2_10][^2_3][^2_9][^2_8]

## Growth trends and projections to 2030

- The Indonesia herbal medicine market (jamu + herbal supplements + teas + OTC herbal) is estimated to grow from **USD 13.732 billion in 2024 to about USD 25.459 billion in 2033**, implying a **CAGR of roughly 7.1%**.[^2_8]
- A 2025 overview of the Indonesian supplements market projects that **the supplements market alone could surpass USD 4.7 billion by 2030**, with rising health awareness and a growing middle class as key drivers.[^2_4]
- Euromonitor’s herbal/traditional products report describes **continued retail value growth through 2029**, underpinned by deep cultural trust in jamu and increased interest in holistic wellness among urban consumers.[^2_3]
- Grand View Research expects **Indonesia’s liquid dietary supplements market** (heavily botanical and jamu‑inspired) to climb from **USD 140.2 million in 2024 to USD 248.9 million by 2030**, showing especially strong momentum in liquid and RTD formats.[^2_7]

Narrative you can use: **herbal medicine and related supplements in Indonesia are on a mid‑single to high‑single‑digit annual growth path through 2030, with modernization (packaged, RTD, clinical branding) driving formal market expansion while traditional consumption remains high.**[^2_4][^2_3][^2_7][^2_8]

## Key official and industry references

- **Ministry of Health / Balitbangkes – Ristoja & Riskesdas**  
  - Ristoja summary via GP Jamu: **59.6% of Indonesians consume jamu; 72.62% of Javanese residents consume jamu.**[^2_2]
  - Riskesdas 2018 (cited in recent 2023–2024 articles): **59.12% of Indonesians consume jamu; 95.6% report benefits.**[^2_1]

- **BPOM (Badan Pengawas Obat dan Makanan)**  
  - Public communications on jamu and “obat bahan alam” citing **IDR 20–23 trillion national jamu/herbal sales potential** and emphasizing integration of jamu into health services and development of standardized herbal medicines.[^2_11][^2_9][^2_10]

- **Industry/market research**  
  - Custom Market Insights / Enciety summary: **Indonesia herbal medicine market USD 13.732B in 2024, 7.1% CAGR to 2033.**[^2_8]
  - Euromonitor, “Herbal/Traditional Products in Indonesia”: 2020–2024 retail data and forecasts to 2029.[^2_3]
  - Grand View Research, “Indonesia Liquid Dietary Supplements Market Report, 2030.”[^2_7]
  - Asian Insiders 2025 note on Indonesia supplements market reaching **>USD 4.7B by 2030.**[^2_4]

If you tell me your main use (e.g., pitch deck vs YouTube explainer), I can condense this into 2–3 highly visual, statistic‑heavy points tailored to that format.

# What are the latest statistics for wellness tourism in Solo (Surakarta), Indonesia for 2024-2025? Please provide:
- Number of wellness tourism visitors to Solo
- Revenue from wellness tourism sector
- Government initiatives or programs supporting wellness tourism in Solo
- Solo's ranking among Indonesian wellness tourism destinations
- Official data from Dinas Pariwisata Surakarta or Ministry of Tourism

Solo's wellness tourism sector is emerging rapidly as a national priority, with 2024 marking a breakout year of 4.4 million total visitors and government-backed events driving momentum into 2025. Official data from Dinas Pariwisata Surakarta and Kemenparekraf highlight Solo as a pilot project, but wellness-specific visitor and revenue stats are not yet tracked separately from general tourism.[^3_1][^3_2][^3_3]

## Wellness visitors (2024–2025)

- **Event impacts**: WIW 2025 projected **Rp 8.5–9 billion in UMKM transactions** from 5,000 visitors; general 2024 attraction revenue hit **Rp 11.63 trillion** per BPS, but not wellness-split.[^3_10][^3_5]
- **>100 UMKM** active in wellness (spa, jamu, yoga), supporting economic spillovers without quantified totals.[^3_1]

## Government initiatives

- **Wonderful Indonesia Wellness (WIW) 2025**: National Kemenparekraf program launched Nov 1, 2025, in Solo (Royal Surakarta Wellness Festival at Balekambang); includes Javanese wisdom immersion, jamu making, royal dance therapy, holy journeys.[^3_6][^3_11][^3_2]

- Historical pilots since 2021 (Aroma Wellness Festival) evolved into 2025 national push.[^3_13]

## Solo's ranking

- **National pilot/emerging leader**: Designated **key wellness destination** with Yogya/Bali by Kemenparekraf; "pilot project" status since 2021, reaffirmed 2025 as "ikon wisata kebugaran berbasis budaya."[^3_2][^3_12][^3_13]
- No numerical ranking (e.g., #1–10) in official Dinas Pariwisata or Ministry reports; positioned as **"alternative to Bali/Yogyakarta"** for cultural wellness (jamu, dance, spiritual).[^3_11][^3_1]
- Indonesia #1 SEA wellness economy (USD 56.4B in 2023), with Solo elevated via 7 categories: eco-nature, jamu/herbal, healthy cuisine, fitness, arts, spiritual, spa.[^3_8][^3_11]

# What is the size and growth of Indonesia's wellness tourism industry in 2024-2025? Include:
- Total wellness tourism revenue in USD
- Number of wellness tourists (domestic and international)
- Annual growth rate and projections through 2029
- Key wellness tourism segments (spa, herbal therapy, retreat centers)
- Comparison with regional competitors (Thailand, Malaysia, Bali)
- Official sources from Ministry of Tourism or industry reports

Indonesia's wellness tourism is a high-growth niche within its broader USD 56+ billion tourism recovery, valued at **USD 1.7 billion** in recent estimates and projected to expand rapidly through 2029 alongside the global trend. Kemenparekraf positions it as a national priority via events like Wonderful Indonesia Wellness 2025, though official segregated stats remain limited.[^4_1][^4_2][^4_3]

## Total revenue (2024–2025)

- **Wellness tourism**: **USD 1.7 billion** (2023–2025 estimate from Global Wellness Institute data), representing mindful travel integrating health with local culture.[^4_2]
- **Broader wellness economy context**: Indonesia's total wellness market at **USD 36.4 billion** (Asia-Pacific #7, global #19), with **traditional/complementary medicine** (jamu, herbal) at **USD 5.6 billion**.[^4_2]
- **National tourism receipts**: Q3 2025 hit **USD 5.624 billion** (up from prior quarters), with wellness as a rising subset; no 2024–2025 wellness-specific from Kemenparekraf/BI yet.[^4_4][^4_5]

## Number of wellness tourists

- No official segregated counts; wellness is embedded in totals: **11.6 million international arrivals (wisman) Jan–Oct 2024** (target 14.3M full-year), **839 million domestic trips (wisnus)** same period.[^4_6][^4_7]
- Events like WIW 2025 drew **~3,700+ visitors** (target 5,000), signaling scale.[^4_1]
- Per capita tourism spend aligns with wellness appeal, but Kemenparekraf tracks via general arrivals (e.g., 1.31M wisman Jul 2024).[^4_8]

## Growth rate and projections

- **Annual growth**: Global wellness tourism at **9.1% CAGR through 2029**; Indonesia aligned, with wellness economy rebounding post-COVID.[^4_2]
- **Asia-Pacific wellness tourism**: From **USD 204.18 billion in 2026** at **8.74% CAGR to USD 310.56 billion by 2031**; Indonesia benefits via jamu/spiritual niches.[^4_9]
- Kemenparekraf Outlook 2024–2025 emphasizes health/wellness as top trend (56% experts), targeting quality over volume.[^4_10][^4_3]

## Key segments

- **Traditional & complementary medicine** (jamu/herbal therapy): **USD 5.6 billion** leader, core to retreats.[^4_2]
- **Spa and wellness retreats**: Bali, Yogyakarta, Solo pillars; includes yoga, palace rituals, rural healing.[^4_2]
- **Other**: Healthy cuisine, fitness (dance therapy), spiritual journeys, eco-nature; 7 categories formalized by Kemenparekraf.[^4_11]

## Regional comparison

| Country/Region | Wellness tourism revenue (recent) | Growth notes | Source |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|--------------|--------|
| **Indonesia** | USD 1.7B (wellness tourism); USD 36.4B total wellness | 9.1% projected CAGR; #1 SEA wellness economy USD 56.4B[^4_2][^4_1] | [^4_2] |
| **Thailand** | USD 12.34B (2023) | 119.5% YoY 2022–23; #1 Asia growth 28.4% | [^4_12] |
| **Malaysia** | Not specified; part of APAC USD 204B+ | Strong in thermal springs, medical tourism | [^4_9] |
| **Bali (Indonesia subset)** | Integrated in national; eco-luxury leader | Global recognition for spas/retreats | [^4_2] |

Indonesia trails Thailand in scale but leads SEA wellness economy value; focuses on cultural authenticity vs Thailand's volume.[^4_12][^4_13][^4_2]

- Registration process and timeline for herbal products
- Cost of BPOM registration and certification
- Special provisions for UMKM/SMEs (Usaha Mikro Kecil Menengah)
- Recent regulatory changes or updates in 2024
- Official BPOM website references

BPOM's regulations for obat tradisional (OT, including jamu) production emphasize Good Manufacturing Practices (CPOTB/CPOTBBA), online registration via ASROT/e-BPOM, and SME facilitations as of late 2025. Key updates in 2024–2025 focus on labeling, risk assessments, and OBA (obat bahan alam) alignment with UU Kesehatan 2023.[^5_1][^5_2][^5_3][^5_4]

## CPOTB Requirements

- **PerBPOM No. 11 Tahun 2025 tentang CPOB**: Updates Cara Pembuatan Obat dan Bahan Obat (Good Manufacturing Practice for drugs/raw materials), ensuring quality consistency for OT; applies to traditional forms with stricter validation for claims and stability.[^5_2][^5_5]
- Replaces/aligns prior CPOTB; mandates facility certification, hygiene, documentation, and personnel training; inspections verify compliance before ML number issuance.[^5_2]
- For OT/herbal: Focus on raw material sourcing, extraction processes, and contamination controls per PerBPOM No. 26/2025 on risk studies for natural ingredients.[^5_1]

## Registration Process and Timeline

- **Online via ASROT (Sistem Registrasi Online Terpadu)**: Register company → upload docs (formula, stability tests, packaging design, GMP cert) → admin review → payment → evaluation → ML issuance.[^5_6][^5_7]
- **Timelines (hari kerja/HK)**: New low-risk OT: 7–90 HK depending on category; renewals/variations faster (e.g., 7 HK for simple changes).[^5_7]
- Required: TTE (electronic signature), 2D barcode; post-submission, products get temporary edar permit during review.[^5_6]

## Registration and Certification Costs

- **PNBP fees per PP No. 32/2017**: Vary by risk/product type; low-risk OT ~Rp 100,000–500,000 per registration (exact tariffs in lampiran).[^5_6]
- **CPOTB/CPOB certification**: Inspection fees ~Rp 5–20 million depending on facility size; annual renewals extra.[^5_6]
- No fixed public quote for 2025; check e-BPOM for current PNBP table.

## Provisions for UMKM/SMEs

- **50% fee reduction** on registration per PP 32/2017 for certified UMKM (micro/small).[^5_8]
- Simplified docs for low-risk: No full clinical data needed; focus on formula, stability, GMP basics.[^5_6]
- Programs like Istana UMKM BPOM offer guidance, free webinars; exemptions for certain informal jamu sellers but ML required for commercial scale.[^5_6]

## 2024 Regulatory Changes

- **PerBPOM No. 10/2024 (Jun)**: Labeling rules for OBA/OT/kuasi/supplements; mandatory accurate claims, warnings; 24-month transition for existing products.[^5_3]
- **PerBPOM No. 25/2023 revised 2024–2025**: OBA registration criteria; adds innovation categories, calendar days vs workdays, export flexibilities.[^5_4]
- **PerBPOM No. 26/2025**: Risk assessments for natural ingredients in OT/OBA, post-PP 28/2024 implementing UU Kesehatan.[^5_1]
- Shift from CPOTB to CPOB terminology; stricter multitarget claims.[^5_4]

# What is the process and cost to establish an LSP (Lembaga Sertifikasi Profesi) for herbal medicine training in Indonesia in 2024-2025? Include:
- BNSP licensing requirements and fees
- Required infrastructure and assessors
- Timeline from application to approval
- Ongoing operational costs
- Revenue potential from certification programs

Establishing an LSP for herbal medicine training requires BNSP licensing under PerBNSP No. 1/2014 (updated processes as of 2026), starting with legal entity formation and skema development. It's feasible for asosiasi or education bodies, with herbal niches in demand but no specific fast-track.[^8_1][^8_2][^8_3]

## BNSP Licensing Requirements and Fees

- **Legal entity**: Badan hukum (asosiasi/perkumpulan/PT foundation); akta notaris, NPWP, structure organ (independent certification committee).[^8_2][^8_3]
- **Core elements**: Developed skema sertifikasi (KKNI-aligned for herbalist/penyehat tradisional), qualified asesors (min 3–5 BNSP-certified per skema), QMS (ISO 17065-like), facilities (office, assessment room).[^8_3][^8_4]
- **Docs**: Org chart, skema manual, asesor list, SOPs, facilities proof.[^8_3]
- **Fees**: Initial lisensi ~Rp 25–50 million (PNBP + admin); annual renewal Rp 10–20M; no exact 2025 quote, varies by skema complexity.[^8_3]

## Infrastructure and Assessors

- **Infrastructure**: Office (min 100m²), assessment venue (theory/practice for herbal mixing/ID), IT (SISERTI integration), secure doc storage.[^8_3]
- **Assessors**: Min 3 per skema; BNSP-certified, 3+ years herbal exp, ongoing training; master asesor for oversight.[^8_4]

## Timeline from Application to Approval

- **Total**: 3–6 months; prep 1–2 months (skema/docs), submission → verification 1 month, witness audit 1 month, lisensi issuance 1 month.[^8_5]
- Alur: Prep → submit to BNSP → dokumen check → skema witness → facilities audit → lisensi (valid 3 years).[^8_5][^8_3]

## Ongoing Operational Costs

- **Annual**: Rp 100–300M; asesor fees (Rp 1–2M/session), office/staff Rp 50M+, marketing Rp 20M, SISERTI/BNSP fees Rp 10M, renewals.[^8_3]
- Per cert: Rp 500K–1M operational (venue, materials).

## Revenue Potential

- **Per participant**: Rp 1.5–6M (e.g., herbalist batches); 20–50 participants/batch x 10 batches/year = Rp 300M–3B revenue.[^8_6]
- Scalable with multiple skema (herbalist, jamu spa); grants from Kemenkes/Kemenparekraf for wellness; profit margin 30–50% post-costs.

## Process Summary Table

| Step | Description | Duration | Cost |
|------|-------------|----------|------|
| 1. Prep | Legalitas, skema, asesors [^8_3] | 1–2 mo | Rp 50–100M |
| 2. Submit | Dok to BNSP [^8_1] | 1 wk | Rp 25M lisensi |
| 3. Verification/Witness | Audit skema/facilities [^8_5] | 1–2 mo | Rp 20M travel |
| 4. Lisensi | 3-yr valid [^8_3] | 2–4 wks | Included |
| Ongoing | Ops/renewal | Annual | Rp 100–300M |

Start at bnsp.go.id/lsp; join asosiasi profesi for support. Herbal LSP viable given jamu growth.[^8_7]

## Revenue and Profit Margins

- **Client side**: Buy Rp 35k/unit, sell Rp 70k+; 1k pcs = Rp 35M revenue, Rp 25k/unit margin (~70%).[^11_10]

Shared manufacturing facilities (fasilitas bersama/PKRT/CPOTB bertahap) in Indonesia's herbal industry enable UMKM to access CPOTB-compliant production without full investment, via government-backed clusters in Jawa Tengah/Jatim. Success hinges on klaster integration and BPOM mentoring.[^12_1][^12_2][^12_3][^12_4]

## Case Studies

- **Klaster Obat Tradisional Jawa Tengah (Kemenkop UKM + BPOM)**: Sentra jamu Nguter Sukoharjo (rumahan/gendong); shared drying/grinding via koperasi; sales up 300–400% during COVID via unified marketing.[^12_3][^12_1]
- **Desa Ekowisata Pampang (Yogyakarta)**: Community jamu center; warga plant/process together (beras kencur, kunyit); tourism revenue from Omah Jamu demos; expanded from 1 producer to village-wide.[^12_5]
- **BBPOM Semarang UKOT/UMOT Program**: 11/15 UKOT certified CPOTB Tahap 1 (2021); shared facilities boosted production quality for jamu ratoh/ekstrak.[^12_4]
- **Sido Muncul Expansion (Tangerang)**: Semi-shared model with UMKM suppliers; CPOTB-certified lines for traditional-modern jamu; exports to 5+ countries.[^12_6]

## Revenue Streams and Sustainability

- **Streams**: Fee-per-batch (Rp 20k–35k/kg processing), membership (Rp 1–5M/yr), sales commissions (10–20% unified branding), tourism/workshops (Rp 50k/visitor).[^12_5][^12_3]
- **Sustainability**: Klaster subsidies for raw materials/marketing; eco-tourism (jamu-making classes); value-add (packaged exports); koperasi pooling for bulk buys.[^12_1]

## Challenges and Success Factors

| Challenges | Success Factors |
|------------|-----------------|
| Raw material shortages, low CPOTB adoption [^12_1][^12_2] | BPOM mentoring/CPOTB bertahap, koperasi structure [^12_4][^12_7] |
| Capital/equipment access | Gov grants (Kemenkop), unified marketing [^12_1] |
| Market competition | Tourism integration, standardization [^12_5] |

## Government Support Programs

- **BPOM Fasilitas Bersama/PKRT**: Shared CPOTB facilities for UKOT/UMOT; conditional approvals during transitions.[^12_8][^12_9]
- **Program Pengembangan UMKM OT (7 K/L + BPOM)**: SIPEMANDU jejaring for perizinan/modal/pasar; fasilitator training (2018+).[^12_2][^12_10][^12_7]
- **Kemenkop Klaster OT**: Sentra development (Jateng/Jatim); 300–400% sales boost via clusters.[^12_1]
- **Kemenperin/BPOM CPOTB Bertahap**: Phased cert for shared access; Orang Tua Angkat mentoring.[^12_7]

## Partnership Models with UMKM

- **Koperasi Klaster**: UMKM pool resources for shared dryer/grinder; revenue split; e.g., Nguter Sukoharjo.[^12_3]
- **BPOM-Pemda-UMKM**: Facilitator-led (e.g., Semarang: 73% cert rate); shared PKRT for production/distribution.[^12_4]
- **Desa/Wisata Model**: Community centers (Pampang); UMKM provide labor/raw, facility handles processing/sales.[^12_5]
- **Corporate-UMKM**: Sido Muncul supplies equipment/training for supplier UMKM; quality contracts.[^12_6]

Scale via Kemenkop/BPOM programs in Yogyakarta for jamu hubs; 87% OT industry is UMKM-ready for clusters.[^12_1]

- Services offered
- Capacity and pricing
- Strengths and gaps in current offerings
- Opportunities for differentiation

Solo/Surakarta and Central Java host strong herbal ecosystems via Poltekkes, Balai Besar POM Semarang, and klaster like Nguter Sukoharjo, focusing on education/training over large-scale processing in 2024–2025.

- **Wellness/Export Focus**: BNSP cert + jamu barista for tourism (Solo Wellness Expo tie-in).
- **Digital/Hybrid**: Online CPOTB + n8n automation for US market (your niche).
- **Corporate Partnerships**: Sido Muncul CSR for funding; target 6+ shorts/day content from facility.

Leverage Solo's "Wellness City" pilot for hybrid training/production.[^14_6]

# What is the economic impact of the herbal medicine industry on employment and GDP in Indonesia in 2024? Include:
- Number of jobs in herbal sector
- Contribution to GDP
- Impact on rural communities and farmers
- Alignment with UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
- Government targets for industry growth

Indonesia's herbal medicine industry, valued at ~Rp 20 trillion domestically in 2024, contributes modestly to GDP (<0.3% of OT subsector) but drives significant rural employment via 87% UMKM dominance and strong agricultural linkages. It aligns with SDGs through sustainable farming and job creation.[^17_1][^17_2][^17_3][^17_4]

## Employment Impact

- **Jobs**: 150,000+ formal workers in jamu alone (BPOM 2024); total OT industry padat karya with 87.2% UMKM, implying 500k+ including informal/gendong sellers.[^17_2][^17_3]
- **Multiplier**: Backward linkage to pertanian (99% local raw materials); sustains petani temulawak/kunyit/jahe in Jateng/Jatim klaster.[^17_2]

## GDP Contribution

- **Direct**: <0.3% of "kimia, farmasi, obat tradisional" subsector (2022–23); broader herbal ~Rp 20T domestic sales (~USD 1.25B at Rp16k/USD).[^17_3][^17_1]
- **Indirect**: Ekspor obat bahan alam USD 639M Jan-Sep 2024 (Rp9.9T); multiplier from hulu-hilir (pertanian-logistik-industri).[^17_5]

## Rural Communities and Farmers Impact

- **Rural boost**: Klaster like Nguter Sukoharjo employ hundreds; sales up 300–400% via unified processing/marketing; empowers women/petani urban.[^17_2]
- **Value-add**: Reduces raw export dependency; e.g., petani jahe/temulawak get premium prices via UMKM chains.

## SDG Alignment

- **SDG 8 (Decent Work/Econ Growth)**: Padat karya jobs; SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) via sustainable ag; SDG 3 (Health) jamu imunitas; SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption).[^17_4]
- **UNESCO WBTb**: Jamu wellness culture boosts SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities).

## Government Targets

- **Sales**: Rp 23T domestic by 2025 (from Rp20T); ekspor growth via PPJAI/FDA push.[^17_6][^17_3]
- **Naik Kelas**: 15 IOT as OTA for UMKM; 19k jamu products, 99 OHT, 33 fitofarmaka.[^17_3]
- **House of Wellness**: Kemenperin facilities for sim plisia/OBA scale-up.[^17_5]

Industry poised for growth via klaster/ekspor, sustaining rural economies.[^17_5][^17_2]
